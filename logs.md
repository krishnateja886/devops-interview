# SRE Challenge 1 - everyone love logs

You are asked to build an Elasticsearch cluster and Kibana server in cloud (AWS) to collect logs.

Please consider following questions when you design the solution.
- How to provision the cluster in 30 miniutes
- How to scale up or down the cluster
- How to prevent unauthorized access to the cluster
- How to ship logs from application to the elasticsearch cluster
- How to monitor the performance of the cluster
- What about if the applications are running in multiple regions, (one system in us-east-1 and one system in us-west-2)

Design your solution in detail, estimate the effort required.
Please implement part of the solution designed above, commit it into a repo and share it with us.
